# We All Learn 🤔

## What it's about 🥳

This project is an extension of my [Mathu Learns](http://mathu-learns.netlify.com) project - a tool I built for myself to track the things I'm learning everyday, fetching and updating using the ``AirTable API``. You can view the source code for this [here.](https://github.com/mathurahravigulan/mathu-learns)

After much response, I wanted to make it easy for anyone to record what they're learning every day all in one application, without having to go to any third-party applications. 

Not every day needs to be productive or involve shipping code. But every day is about learning something new whether it be about technology, life lessons, and the why - why we do the things we do. Life is short. Let's take everything in, being grateful, and mindful ❤️
